Here now is my work from the question? “What will I become 5 or 10 years from now” it took me several weeks and I got a serious headache thinking about it well any way I came up with my own research about this, so far I managed to get some ideas and possibilities, I questioned some of my relatives and my family regarding my question somehow my efforts is worth trying for because I have earned a good answers through them. No one can predict his own future and no one exactly can tell what will be your life next 5 or 10 years from 2010, there’s a possibility that you will die or there’s a possibility that you will have your own family you just can’t tell. I hope my work help not just me but others as well. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my career and what will I become? As I reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that I would like to accomplish within next five or ten years to come. In five or ten years I can see myself having many of my goal accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goals to fulfill my life. I know it’s not easy to know your life next five or ten years but I just can’t stop thinking about it whenever I think about it I always smile seeing the sky above showing that I achieve my goals and see my family proud of me. Ten years from now I see myself as a very successful person. I would be 25 years old have a job to help support my family while I attend college. I would live in a large house on a decent amount of property. I hope to be married or getting married in ten years.
